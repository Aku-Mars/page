## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have a modern web browser.
    *   (For Developers) If you are running this project locally and want to use any features that might involve the Gemini API (like potential future dynamic content generation, though the current build is self-contained for gameplay), ensure you have an API key for the Gemini API. Set this key as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in your project's environment (e.g., in a `.env` file if your setup supports it, `API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here`). The game logic accesses it via `process.env.API_KEY`. **The application will not ask you for the API key through the UI.**
    *   To run locally with a simple HTTP server (recommended for proper ES module loading and asset paths), navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npx serve .` (you might need to install `serve` globally first via `npm install -g serve` or use `npm start` if you have the `package.json` from this update). Alternatively, Python's `python -m http.server` also works.

2.  **Starting the Game:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file in your browser (ideally via a local HTTP server).
    *   You'll be greeted with the authentication screen. You can **Register** a new account or **Login** if you've played before.
    *   **Character Creation:** Choose a name for your hero and select one of the three available classes (Knight, Mage, Rogue).
    *   **The Village:** You'll start in Windfall Village. From here, you can:
        *   Visit the **Shop** to buy and sell items.
        *   Talk to the **Old Mage** for cryptic advice.
        *   **Rest** to recover some HP/MP (this adds a time penalty to your leaderboard score).
        *   View the **Leaderboard**.
        *   **Go on Adventure** to select a stage and explore.
    *   **Adventure:** Select a stage to explore. You'll encounter monsters or find the stage boss.
    *   **Combat:** Fight monsters in turn-based combat. Use your attacks, spells, and items wisely!
    *   **Progression:** Defeat monsters to gain XP, level up, find gold and items, and unlock new stages.

3.  **Goal:**
    *   Progress through all 25 main stages, defeat Dragon Knight Aetharion, and then face the ultimate secret boss to truly save the realms!

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

*   **API Key for Gemini:** As mentioned in "How to Play", the application expects the Gemini API key to be available as `process.env.API_KEY`. This is essential for any direct API calls.
*   **Image Assets:** All monster and stage images are currently expected to be in the `/public/images/monsters/` and `/public/images/stages/` directories respectively. The paths are defined in `constants.tsx`.
*   **Sound Assets:** Song files (`.mp3`) should be placed in `public/sounds/songs/` and sound effect files (`.wav`) in `public/sounds/sfx/`. The mapping is in `soundManager.ts`.

## üíª Technologies Used

*   **React 19**
*   **TypeScript**
*   **TailwindCSS** (via CDN)
*   **@google/genai (Gemini API Client)** for potential generative features (though core gameplay is self-contained).
*   HTML5 & CSS3
*   ES6 Modules
